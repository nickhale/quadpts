Fast and accurate Gauss quadrature point computation.

This repo is no longer maintained. 

Up to date Matlab implementations of the code can be found in [Chebfun](http://gihub.com/chebfun/chebfun).

For computing the Gauss-Legendre nodes and weights in C, I recommend Ignance Bogaert's code, which can be found [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fastgausslegendrequadrature/).
